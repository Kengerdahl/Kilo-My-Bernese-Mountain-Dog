            <p>My dogs name is Kilo and she was born on May 15,2023. She is a perbread Bernese Mountain dog. Kilo is going to be 3 years old and is still very much like a puppy. Before I got Kilo I had to do alot of research about her breed as there are many things that can go wrong with a Berner (I will get to those later with links on those issues).</p>

            <p>Kilo was the runt of her litter, and the only one who's face was all white. Her nose was so small and pink and her pads were pink except for one toe pad it was black. Kilo was so small that she fit in the palm of my hand,and she would cry unless she was being held. </p>

            <p>Kilo's breed is a very loving, playful, loyal to their person. So far Kilo has had one heck of a life, from near death experinces, to hunting, quadding, and even on her brakeout runs.</p>
